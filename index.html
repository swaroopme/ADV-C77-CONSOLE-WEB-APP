    <p>To keep the console window open in Visual Studio without using the Console.ReadLine () method, you should run the application without debug mode by pressing Ctrl+F5 or by clicking on the menu Debug > Start without Debugging option. This way the application remains active below until the user presses a key. To open console screen you have to right click first on the code andd select the 3rd last option - open with live server and then again right click  on the screen and select the last option inspect and the console will open. to print anything on console we have to start writing on the last line and write <--script--> and Start write console . log without space and make a bracket and write the text oth name of the variable in which you have written something</p>

        var first_name = "Swaroop ";
        console.log(first_name);
        var last_name = "Kamble";
        console.log(last_name);
        var full_name = first_name.concat(last_name);
        console.log(full_name);
        var square_root = Math.sqrt(365); 
        console.log(square_root);
        var maximum_number = Math.max(50, 49);
        console.log(maximum_number);
        var minimum_number = Math.min(50, 49);
        console.log(minimum_number);
        var power_eg_1 = Math.pow(3, 5);
        console.log(power_number);
